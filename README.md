## Pong Game in C++ with Raylib
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game written in C++ using the Raylib library.
The game supports two-player mode, where each player controls a paddle using the keyboard. Player 1 uses the W and S keys, while Player 2 uses the Up and Down arrow keys.
